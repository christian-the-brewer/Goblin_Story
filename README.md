The game I am proposing is called Goblin Story and is a text-based rpg where you are a young goblin who is searching for The Staff of the Lich King in order to remove the curse put on their family. The game will be pretty linear at its most basic, but if I am able I would like to expand it to have randomly selected encounters where the player fights different enemies of varying degrees of dificulty and with different damage type resistances and weaknesses. After a set number of enemies defeated, the player will face The Lich King, and win the game if they defeat them. After every few enemies the player will encounter a goblin enclave where they will fully heal and restore Mana, as well as purchase upgrades to their weapons and purchase potions. Enemies will drop gold. 

Combat:
    Combat will be pretty simple, with the player being able to select one action such as attacking with their sword, casting a spell, or healing with a potion. After they click a button coresponding to the action they want to take, the enemy will make an attack. I want to mechanics to be similar to other basic rpgs, where the player and enemies will have an Armor Class, and for an attack you roll a d20 and add your Attack score to that number. If that number is equal to or greater than the Armor Class, the attack hits and damage is calculated. Enemies will have a single attack that does a range of damage. The player will have their sword that does 5-15 damage, or the Spell Fireball that does 30 damage and always hits. It will be powerful, but use up Mana points, so the player will not be able to spam it. When the enemy health reaches 0 or lower, the game will display how much gold was received and ask for the player to click "Venture forth" to continue to the next encounter or enclave. 

Enclaves:
    Enclaves will be the towns for the player. There will be 4 options in the enclave screen: 
        Blacksmith: Clikcing this will bring up the blacksmith where youc an click sword or armor upgrades to increase damage or AC for gold.

        Shaman's Hut: Clicking will bring the player to the shaman who sells upgrades for their spell

        Merchant: The merchant sells potions. I am thinking of also offering expensive items that can permantly buff the players health, mana, or attack. 

        Venture Forth: This option leaves the enclave and the player faces the next encounter.

The top of the screen will always show:
Health 41/50   Mana 20/25  Gold 40

The health bar will start out with a background color of green and turn to orange when it lowers to 30, and red when lowers to 20

The mana bar will have a background of blue and change to orange and red at 10 and 5, respectively. 


Potions will increase the players temporary health up to their maximum health upon use. Same with mana potions for mana. 

Constructing enemies:
    Enemies will have 5 stats:
        Health: How many hit points
        Armor Class: hhow hard they are to hit
        Attack: How good they are are landing a blow
        Damage: The range of damage they can deal
        Drop: The range of gold they drop when defeated. 

I am thinking of having at least 4 enemies: Scamps, Adventurers, Heroes, and The Lich King

Early levels I will have the player encounter mostly Scamps and some adventurers, then mostly adventurers and some heroes, then mostly heroes before the lich king.


Extras I would like to implement:
    Randomly selected encounters:

    Enemey resistances and weaknesses:

    Multiple spells and weapons: Sword and Club for slashing and blunt damage. Fireball and Frost for spells. Maybe have the option to but Inferno and Blizzard for a lot of gold that do a lot more damage but cost more Mana.

    Overworld map that shows your progress through the Underdark: Maybe use canvas to draw a map that shows a line and small boxes for encounters or enclaves
